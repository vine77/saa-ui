[Webshims Lib](http://aFarkas.github.com/webshim/demos/index.html) - The polyfilling, capability based loading JavaScript Library
================================

Features
------------------

General Principles:

* HTML5 compliant: correctly and accurately implemented (HTML5) Markup-, JS- and DOM-APIs  
* capability based loading: extremely lightweight in modern browsers
* cross-browser support: All A-Graded browsers including latest version of Opera are tested
* extendable: if we have not implemented a feature you want, you can easily implement it on your own

Implemented Features:

* HTML5 shiv and innerShiv solution including basic CSS-support
* canvas
* HTML5 form features including: constraint validation and form widgets (input[type="range"], input[type="date"], input[type="number"], output, input[list]/datalist)
* HTML5 audio/video/track implementation
* interactive elements: summary/details
* JSON (stringify and parse)
* localStorage/sessionStorage
* geolocation
* ECMAScript 5 / JavaScript 1.8.5 features 


How To Use
------------------

* Simply [download Webshims Lib](http://corrupt-system.de/webshims-stable.zip) and put the js-webshim-folder in your project
* Include the JavaScript:

---------------
	<script src="js/jquery.js"></script>
	// Simple change
	<script src="js-webshim/minified/extras/modernizr-custom.js"></script> 
	// 'Use your own' variant
	<script src="js/Modernizr-custom.js"></script> 

	<script src="js-webshim/minified/polyfiller.js"></script> 

	<script> 
		//load and implement all unsupported features 
		$.webshims.polyfill();
		
		//or only load a specific feature
		//$.webshims.polyfill('geolocation json-storage');
	</script>
---------------

* Wait till everything has been loaded and then use it:

--------------
	<script> 
		$(function(){
			//work with JSON and localStorage 
			var userData = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('userData')) || {visits: 0};
			$('#visits').html(userData.visits);
			//...
		});
	</script>
