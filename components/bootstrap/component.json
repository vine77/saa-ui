[Please open a new issue](https://github.com/jasny/bootstrap/issues). Before opening any issue, please search for existing issues and read the [Issue Guidelines](https://github.com/necolas/issue-guidelines), written by [Nicolas Gallagher](https://github.com/necolas/).\n\n\n\n## Community\n\n\nWe have included a makefile with convenience methods for working with the Bootstrap library.\n\n+ **dependencies**\nOur makefile depends on you having recess, connect, uglify.js, and jshint installed. To install, just run the following command in npm:\n\n```\n$ npm install recess connect uglify-js jshint -g\n```\n\n+ **build** - `make`\nRuns the recess compiler to rebuild the `/less` files and compiles the docs pages. Requires recess and uglify-js. <a href=\"http://jasny.github.com/bootstrap/extend.html#compiling\">Read more in our docs &raquo;</a>\n\n+ **test** - `make test`\nRuns jshint and qunit tests headlessly in [phantomjs](http://code.google.com/p/phantomjs/) (used for ci). Depends on having phantomjs installed.\n\n+ **watch** - `make watch`\nThis is a convenience method for watching just Less files and automatically building them whenever you save. Requires the Watchr gem.\n\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nPlease submit all pull requests against *-wip branches.
