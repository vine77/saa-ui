Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br>   any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br>   by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br>   this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br>   Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br>   the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br>   with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br><br>6.

Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br>   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br>   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,<br>   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br>   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br>   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br>   PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Distribution Obligations.<br><br>     3.1. Application of License.<br>     The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are<br>     governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation<br>     Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be<br>     distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version<br>     of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a<br>     copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You<br>     distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code<br>     version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this<br>     License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include<br>     an additional document offering the additional rights described in<br>     Section 3.5.<br><br>     3.2. Availability of Source Code.<br>     Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be<br>     made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License<br>     either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted<br>     Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an<br>     Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic<br>     Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)<br>     months after the date it initially became available, or at least six<br>     (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification<br>     has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for<br>     ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the<br>     Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.<br><br>     3.3. Description of Modifications.<br>     You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a<br>     file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and<br>     the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that<br>     the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original<br>     Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the<br>     Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an<br>     Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the<br>     origin or ownership of the Covered Code.<br><br>     3.4. Intellectual Property Matters<br>          (a) Third Party Claims.<br>          If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's<br>          intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights<br>          granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2,<br>          Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code<br>          distribution titled \"LEGAL\" which describes the claim and the<br>          party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will<br>          know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after<br>          the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2,<br>          Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies<br>          Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps<br>          (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)<br>          reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered<br>          Code that new knowledge has been obtained.<br><br>          (b) Contributor APIs.<br>          If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming<br>          interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which<br>          are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must<br>          also include this information in the LEGAL file.<br><br>               (c)    Representations.<br>          Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to<br>          Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's<br>          Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or<br>          Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by<br>          this License.<br><br>     3.5. Required Notices.<br>     You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source<br>     Code.  If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source<br>     Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a<br>     location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely<br>     to look for such a notice.  If You created one or more Modification(s)<br>     You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in<br>     Exhibit A.  You must also duplicate this License in any documentation<br>     for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership<br>     rights relating to Covered Code.  You may choose to offer, and to<br>     charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability<br>     obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You<br>     may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial<br>     Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than<br>     any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is<br>     offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial<br>     Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the<br>     Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,<br>     support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.<br><br>     3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.<br>     You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the<br>     requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,<br>     and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of<br>     the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,<br>     including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the<br>     obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included<br>     in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or<br>     collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the<br>     Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered<br>     Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may<br>     contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in<br>     compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the<br>     Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's<br>     rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this<br>     License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different<br>     license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ<br>     from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial<br>     Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the<br>     Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by<br>     the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such<br>     terms You offer.<br><br>     3.7. Larger Works.<br>     You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code<br>     not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger<br>     Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the<br>     requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.<br><br>4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.<br><br>     If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this<br>     License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to<br>     statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with<br>     the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)<br>     describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description<br>     must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must<br>     be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the<br>     extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be<br>     sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to<br>     understand it.<br><br>5. Application of this License.<br><br>     This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has<br>     attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.<br><br>6. Versions of the License.<br><br>     6.1. New Versions.<br>     Netscape Communications Corporation (\"Netscape\") may publish revised<br>     and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version<br>     will be given a distinguishing version number.<br><br>     6.2. Effect of New Versions.<br>     Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the<br>     License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that<br>     version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms<br>     of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one<br>     other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to<br>     Covered Code created under this License.<br><br>     6.3. Derivative Works.<br>     If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may<br>     only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code<br>     governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that<br>     the phrases \"Mozilla\", \"MOZILLAPL\", \"MOZPL\", \"Netscape\",<br>     \"MPL\", \"NPL\" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your<br>     license (except to note that your license differs from this License)<br>     and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license<br>     contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and<br>     Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial<br>     Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in<br>     Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of<br>     this License.)<br><br>7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.<br><br>     COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS,<br>     WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,<br>     WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF<br>     DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.<br>     THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE<br>     IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT,<br>     YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE<br>     COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER<br>     OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF<br>     ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.<br><br>8. TERMINATION.<br><br>     8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate<br>     automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure<br>     such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All<br>     sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall<br>     survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their<br>     nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License<br>     shall survive.<br><br>     8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement<br>     claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer<br>     or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom<br>     You file such action is referred to as \"Participant\")  alleging that:<br><br>     (a)  such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly<br>     infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such<br>     Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License<br>     shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively,<br>     unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i)<br>     agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable<br>     royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such<br>     Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to<br>     the Contributor Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days<br>     of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not<br>     mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim<br>     is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under<br>     Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of<br>     the 60 day notice period specified above.<br><br>     (b)  any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's<br>     Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then<br>     any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b)<br>     and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used,<br>     sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that<br>     Participant.<br><br>     8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant<br>     alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or<br>     indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as<br>     by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent<br>     infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses<br>     granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken<br>     into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or<br>     license.<br><br>     8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,<br>     all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)<br>     which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder<br>     prior to termination shall survive termination.<br><br>9.

THIS LIMITATION OF<br>     LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY<br>     RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW<br>     PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE<br>     EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO<br>     THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.<br><br>10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.<br><br>     The Covered Code is a \"commercial item,\" as that term is defined in<br>     48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of \"commercial computer<br>     software\" and \"commercial computer software documentation,\" as such<br>     terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48<br>     C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995),<br>     all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those<br>     rights set forth herein.<br><br>11.

The application of the United Nations Convention on<br>     Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.<br>     Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract<br>     shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this<br>     License.<br><br>12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.<br><br>     As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is<br>     responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,<br>     out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to<br>     work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such<br>     responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or<br>     shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.<br><br>13.
